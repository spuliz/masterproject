Master in Computer Engineering, August 2020. 

Abstract:
Can fashion designers rely on a 2D web applicationto  generate  new  design  of  fashion  garments?  In  this  researchproject,  a  state-of-the-art  generative  model  has  been  deployedon  a  live  web  environment,  where  users  are  able  to  generatebrand   new   fashion   design   images   based   on   user   providedhandbags  or  shirts  shape  and  preferred  textures  accessible  athttp://schedio.pythonanywhere.com/.  The  project  provides  firstan  overview  on  existent  conditional  generative  adversarial  net-work solutions applied to fashion design and then deep dive intothe  technology  used  and  the  technical  implementation  neededto  build  a  web  application.  Challenges  and  limitations  will  alsobe  explained  and  the  results  obtained  from  a  users  survey  willshow some of the challenges that will be addressed with proposedsolutions  to  improve  the  user  experience  as  well  as  the  outputquality  of  the  generated  image  are  reported



The finished web application is available at https://schedio.pythonanywhere.com/
